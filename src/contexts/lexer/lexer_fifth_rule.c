/**
 * 5th rule:
 * If the current character is an unquoted '$' or '`', the shell shall 
 * identify the start of any candidates for parameter expansion 
 * (Parameter Expansion), command substitution (Command Substitution), 
 * or arithmetic expansion (Arithmetic Expansion) from their introductory 
 * unquoted character sequences: '$' or "${", "$(" or '`', and 
 * "$((", respectively. The shell shall read sufficient input to determine 
 * the end of the unit to be expanded (as explained in the cited sections). 
 * While processing the characters, if instances of expansions or quoting are 
 * found nested within the substitution, the shell shall recursively process 
 * them in the manner specified for the construct that is found. The characters
 * found from the beginning of the substitution to its end, allowing for any 
 * recursion necessary to recognize embedded constructs, shall be included 
 * unmodified in the result token, including any embedded or enclosing substitution operators or quotes. The token shall not be delimited by the end of the substitution.
